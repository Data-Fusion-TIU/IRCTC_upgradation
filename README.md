IRCTC Smart Train Reservation System

The Smart Train Reservation System by IRCTC aims to enhance the traditional booking process by introducing a more user-friendly seat selection system. This system allows users to select their desired seats based on criteria such as age groups and proximity to other passengers, along with providing a visual representation of the available seats.

Furthermore, the system includes a feature for dynamic seat pricing, adjusting costs based on seat availability, and utilizes machine learning clustering to recommend seats based on user preferences.
