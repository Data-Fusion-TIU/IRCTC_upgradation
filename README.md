# IRCTC Smart Train Reservation System
The IRCTC Smart Train Reservation System is a cutting-edge platform designed to simplify and enhance the train booking experience for Indian Railways passengers. The system integrates artificial intelligence to provide personalized travel suggestions, offering users smarter alternatives and efficient solutions. It streamlines the entire booking process, enabling travelers to select their preferred seats in real-time through an interactive seat map, while also providing recommendations based on their preferences, booking history, and seat availability.

This project was developed by a team of students comprising Diya Saha (Project Lead & Backend Developer), Pramangshu Das (Data Analyst & Data Scientist), Sanket Sur (Frontend Developer), and Ujjaini Ghosh (Cloud Engineer). Together, they aimed to create an efficient train booking system that leverages AI and machine learning to optimize the reservation process and improve overall user satisfaction.

The primary objectives of this project include enhancing the user experience by implementing AI-driven personalized seat and route suggestions, real-time seat availability checks, and smart travel options for alternate routes or trains when waitlisted. The project also aims to provide a dynamic, interactive seat selection grid for easy booking, manage waitlists efficiently, and ensure high levels of security for user data. Additionally, it integrates real-time data updates to ensure users are informed of any schedule changes, cancellations, or fare revisions.

The project also outlines a clear revenue model, which includes multiple streams such as convenience fees for each booking, premium membership offerings with exclusive benefits, advertisements targeted based on user behavior, sponsorships from travel partners, and commissions on bookings made through platform partners. With these diverse revenue streams, the platform aims to generate significant revenue while keeping user costs minimal. The annual profit projections indicate substantial profitability after deducting operational expenses such as development, maintenance, customer support, transaction processing fees, and marketing.

Looking to the future, the team envisions expanding the system to include real-time train tracking with live updates on delays, cancellations, and estimated time of arrival (ETA). There are also plans to integrate multi-modal transport options, allowing users to seamlessly combine train, bus, and taxi bookings in one platform. Advanced AI and machine learning algorithms will continue to evolve the personalized experience, while user feedback will drive ongoing improvements to the system.

## Technology Used

- Frontend:
HTML/CSS for visual seat selection interface.
JavaScript for dynamic interaction and user inputs.

- Backend:
Python with machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, numpy) for clustering and seat recommendation.
Flask for server-side operations.

- Machine Learning:
SVM (Support Vector Machine): Used for station classification and seat availability prediction.
Clustering Models: Recommends seats based on passenger preferences.


## Features

- Provides nearby stations within 200-250 km when no seats are available, adapting to holidays and weekends. Recommendations for both preceding and succeeding stations from the originating point.
- Visual representation of available and booked seats. Seat selection based on age group and proximity to other passengers.
